## IC2-Tweaker Documentation

Here are documentations of all public classes and methods provided by IC2-Tweaker.
All classes/methods are provided under `mods.ic2` package in ZenScript.

A sample ZenScript file is also provided here: [`Demo.zs`](Demo.zs).

Due to limitation of IC2 API, it is not possible to remove any recipes via CraftTweaker/ZenScript.
Please refer to respective chapters to see if there is alternative solution.

For IC2 Classic refer [here](https://github.com/TinyModularThings/IC2Classic/wiki/How-to-add-custom-Recipes) to do more advanced stuff for recipes unable to be done with crafttweaker methods, like modifying recipe length and adding an exp output.

Also the only recipes to work with Ic2 Classic are the compressor, extractor, macerator, recycler, and scrap box. If you have Ic2c Extras installed the metal former, ore washer, and thermal centrifuge will also work.
